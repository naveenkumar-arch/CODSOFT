    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hello! I'm an enthusiastic and self-motivated aspiring Full Stack Developer with a strong interest in software development, particularly in backend technologies like Core Java and MySQL, and frontend tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm currently focused on mastering Java frameworks like Spring Boot and enhancing my skills in React.js to become job-ready for top tech companies like Zoho.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy learning how things work behind the scenes and love solving real-world problems through code. My learning style combines consistent practice, building mini-projects, and breaking down tough concepts into simple steps. Whether it’s designing responsive websites, working with databases, or connecting it all through Java, I find joy in the full development cycle.
</p>
<p>
  Apart from coding, I’m also improving my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills to prepare for technical interviews and professional work environments. My goal is to become a well-rounded developer who not only writes efficient code but also contributes positively to any team or project I work with.
</p>
